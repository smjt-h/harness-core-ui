stepDescription:
  HTTP: Run HTTP requests containing URLs, methods, headers, assertions, and variables.
  SHELLSCRIPT: Execute scripts in the shell session. The scripts can be executed on the pod/instance running a Harness Delegate or on a remote host in the infrastructure.
  Barrier: Synchronize multiple Pipelines to coordinate deployments systematically.
  K8sRollingRollback: Roll back the workloads deployed by the stage.
  K8sBlueGreenDeploy: Deploy your new app version to the stage environment.
  K8sCanaryDeploy: Define how many pods are deployed for a Canary test of your new service version.
  K8sBGSwapServices: Swap services to route production traffic to the new version of the application and stage traffic to the old version.
  K8sScale: Update the number of pods running for a workload by count or percentage.
  K8sApply: Deploy individual Kubernetes workloads from your stage's Service.
  K8sCanaryDelete: Clean up the workload deployed by the Canary Deployment step.
  K8sDelete: Delete Kubernetes resources by name, manifest path, and release name.
  K8sRollingDeploy: Use a rolling update to schedule new pods on nodes with available resources. This step uses the number of replicas you specified in the Deployment manifest.
  Plugin: Use Docker containers to perform predefined tasks like deploy code, publish artifacts, send notifications, and more.
  Run: Execute one or more commands on a container image in a CI stage.
  GCR: Build an image and push it to Google Container Registry (GCR).
  ECR: Build an image and push it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
  SaveCacheGCS: Preserve files and directories between builds using Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
  RestoreCacheGCS: Restore saved files and directories between builds using Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

  TerraformApply: Apply a Terraform plan or script.
  ResourceConstraint: Queue the number of resources Harness requests during a deployment by placing capacity limits on the requests.
  FlagConfiguration: Add or update Feature Flag configuration.
  HelmDeploy: Performs native Helm deployments. Requires Helm and Tiller and supports basic deployments. Helm charts are also supported in Harness Kubernetes deployments without requiring Helm or Tiller and using all deployment strategies.
  HelmRollback: Rolls back all the deployed objects to the previous version.
  ServiceNowApproval: Use ServiceNow issues to approve steps and stages.
  Policy: Evaluate policy during pipeline execution
