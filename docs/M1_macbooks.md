## Additional Installation Steps for M1 based Macbooks

When following the ReadMe there are additional steps required for users with a M1 MacBook. Please see below:

### Step 1: Install Chromium with Homebrew

`brew install chromium`

If you want to check which chromium your M1 Mac is using, type the following command:

`which chromium`

The chromium should in the homebrew binary directory, as such:

`/opt/homebrew/bin/chromium`

### Step 2 (Optional/Not Required): Allow Chromium to open on your M1 Mac:

If your M1 Mac doesnâ€™t allow third party apps to be open, you may need to give Chromium permission to do so.
